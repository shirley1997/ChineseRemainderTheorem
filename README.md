# Chinesische-Restsatz
a program about calculate numbers using Chinese Remainder Theorem. \\<br>
 Reason why I wrote this program: some assignments of our LA(linear algebra) homework this week are about Chinese remainder theorem,
 i have interested in it cause it's a special way to calculate number with dividend and raminder and it was made by people from my country,China;
 but this is really hard to understand,early this morning i was in library with my friends and we used the whole 3 hours and still didn't work
 out 2 problems about it in our homework paper.so i think maybe i should combine this math problem to programming and
 let computer to calculate it; \\<br>
 \\<br>
 introdution about the files from this program : I use Eclipse to write this program,there are 3 classes in it:CR.class,
 CRclassic.class and CRgeneral.class.\\<br>
 \\<br>
 this first CR.class is from a chinese remainder theorem(abbreviation: CRT) problem
 i saw in the internet this evening: (http://blog.csdn.net/u012340794/article/details/50529557). the problem translation is:
 a man always has 3 cycles: physical power(23 days), feeling(28 days) and intelligence(33 days).
 they all have a peak during the cycle.the length of 3 cycles are different,so usually their peak are also different.people want to know 
 WHEN(which day) 3 peak can all show in one day.the task is:give a day number,which means count from the first day of that yr.output is difference value
 between the day number and the day which 3 peaks are all together. for example:the day number is 10,the other day which 3 peaks all showed up is 12,
 then the result is 12-10=2.
 so let's assume p,e,i ,these 3 number are the peak time(from the first day of the yr) of physical power,feeling and intelligence.d is THE DAY NUMBER.
 they are all integer and all bigger than 0.the result time s is smaller than 23*28*33 =21252.\\<br>
 \\<br>
 the second one which wrote by me is for the classic quetion of CRT.there is a number s,s%3=2,s%5=3,s%7=2,use CRT rules to get the number s.
 the way is just like the first CR.class file.(if you have any quetion about it pls ask me.)\\<br>
 the third one was totally written by me,the goal is to create a program,people just type the divends and remainders they know,computer will 
 calculate for them.and i did it.it's my first middle java program.im happy for it and will keep going.
